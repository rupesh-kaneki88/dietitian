we are responsible for creating a modern website for a dietitian. We will use gsap for the animations with mongodb as database. lets keep the color scheme dark to give the aesthetic look. Keep it very simple. Main objective of the application is, an admin wants to manage the diet plans for their clients. They create a menu for the client, a menu contains number of dishes. and each dish has a separate receipe as well. Then clients can view their menu along with the receipe:
App flow:
admin workflow: 
- lets just keep a login route for authentication
- once authenticated admin can create clients and edit them.
- create a menu with n number of dishes.
- each dish will have a global receipe.

user :
- user can see their menu.
- when they select a dish from their menu a receipe should display.

thats it
